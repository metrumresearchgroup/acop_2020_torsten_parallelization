	abstract = {As computational challenges in optimization and statistical inference grow ever harder, algorithms that utilize derivatives are becoming increasingly more important. The implementation of the derivatives that make these algorithms so powerful, however, is a substantial user burden and the practicality of these algorithms depends critically on tools like automatic differentiation that remove the implementation burden entirely. The Stan Math Library is a C++, reverse-mode automatic differentiation library designed to be usable, extensive and extensible, efficient, scalable, stable, portable, and redistributable in order to facilitate the construction and utilization of such algorithms. Usability is achieved through a simple direct interface and a cleanly abstracted functional interface. The extensive built-in library includes functions for matrix operations, linear algebra, differential equation solving, and most common probability functions. Extensibility derives from a straightforward object-oriented framework for expressions, allowing users to easily create custom functions. Efficiency is achieved through a combination of custom memory management, subexpression caching, traits-based metaprogramming, and expression templates. Partial derivatives for compound functions are evaluated lazily for improved scalability. Stability is achieved by taking care with arithmetic precision in algebraic expressions and providing stable, compound functions where possible. For portability, the library is standards-compliant C++ (03) and has been tested for all major compilers for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.},

	shorttitle = {Avoiding the inverse crime in the {Inverse} {Problem} of electrocardiography},
	abstract = {The Inverse Problem of electrocardiography (IPE) can be summarized as the characterization of the electrical behavior of the heart using measurements obtained by electrodes that are not directly in contact with the cardiac surfaces. Given a data ensemble provided by electrodes, the solution of the IPE requires the design of a mathematical procedure that matches a theoretical model of estimated measurements with that ensemble of data. Common tests of inversion procedures were often made with synthetic data using the same model for computing both predicted and estimated measurements, yielding into overoptimistic results; this is called the Inverse Crime. In practice, the test of an inversion process avoiding the Inverse Crime could be done using a model for the numerically produced simulated data and a different one to invert the data. This work shows the behavior of a procedure designed to characterize regions in the heart with a lack of blood supply (ischemia) avoiding the Inverse Crime. Realistic and experimentally supported models constitute the forward procedure (the Luo-Rudy model for the electrical activity and the volume conductor theory for simulating the electrode measurements) while a simple phenomenological model (the two-current model proposed by Mitchell and Schaeffer) is used during the inversion process.},

	abstract = {The fully discrete adjoint equations and the corresponding adjoint method are derived for a globally high-order accurate discretization of conservation laws on parametrized, deforming domains. The conservation law on the deforming domain is transformed into one on a fixed reference domain by the introduction of a time-dependent mapping that encapsulates the domain deformation and parametrization, resulting in an Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian form of the governing equations. A high-order discontinuous Galerkin method is used to discretize the transformed equation in space and a high-order diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta scheme is used for the temporal discretization. Quantities of interest that take the form of space–time integrals are discretized in a solver-consistent manner. The corresponding fully discrete adjoint method is used to compute exact gradients of quantities of interest along the manifold of solutions of the fully discrete conservation law. These quantities of interest and their gradients are used in the context of gradient-based PDE-constrained optimization. The adjoint method is used to solve two optimal shape and control problems governed by the isentropic, compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The first optimization problem seeks the energetically optimal trajectory of a 2D airfoil given a required initial and final spatial position. The optimization solver, driven by gradients computed via the adjoint method, reduced the total energy required to complete the specified mission nearly an order of magnitude. The second optimization problem seeks the energetically optimal flapping motion and time-morphed geometry of a 2D airfoil given an equality constraint on the x-directed impulse generated on the airfoil. The optimization solver satisfied the impulse constraint to greater than 8 digits of accuracy and reduced the required energy between a factor of 2 and 10, depending on the value of the impulse constraint, as compared to the nominal configuration.},

To quantify the correlation of conjugate exposure and treatment duration with PN risk, a time-to-event model was developed using data from phase I and II studies. The model suggested that PN risk increased with conjugate exposure and treatment cycles, and a trend for increased risk with body weight and albumin concentration. When capping the treatment duration to six to eight cycles, the risk ratio of a dose of 2.4 mg/kg vs. 1.8 mg/kg was ≥1.29; the predicted incidence of grade ≥2 PN at 1.8-2.4 mg/kg dose levels was 17.8-37.2\%, which is comparable with other antimicrotubule agents for lymphoma treatment.},

We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local eﬃciency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give concrete recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},
